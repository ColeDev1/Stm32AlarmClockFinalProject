# Stm32AlarmClockFinalProject

- Import the folder below in STM32IDE as "Existing Projects into Workspace"
- Set WIFI_SSID and WIFI_PASSWORD 
- Find server_ip to put the server's IP address. I used nslookup to know the IP of a website/API.
- In "step 2" you can also specify a path '/get' or others.
- Note: This was pretty much all AI generated because I could not find information on WiFi and how it works.
